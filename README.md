## Branching Strategy 
We will use the GitHub Flow branching strategy.
1. The main branch is sacred and MUST always be releasable
2. Everyone MUST commit their changes to a separate local development branch 
   1. Local development branches SHOULD have a descriptive name for the feature being developed.
   2. Commits SHOULD be small, focused, and descriptive
3. Code changes MUST be merged via pull requests
   1. At least one other person MUST review and accept the pull request
   2. Tests MUST be passing on the local development before creating a pull request
   3. Local development branches SHOULD be rebased onto main before creating a pull request
